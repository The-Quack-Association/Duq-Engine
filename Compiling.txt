Duq Engine Compiling Guide

For Windows

  Prerequisites:
   https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php The SFML SDK is required for proper linking.
   https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ Choose Visual Studio instead of Visual Studio Code. The community version is free.
   http://glew.sourceforge.net/index.html Download the prebult binaries and install them.

 For compiling on windows you will need Visual Studio to link SFML Libraries (SFML/Graphics, SFML/System, SFML/Window, SFML/Audio, SFML/Network) for creating the window and GLEW (GL/glew) for OpenGL.

For Linux

  Prerequisites:
   
   Arch:
    sudo pacman -S sfml
    sudo pacman -S glew

   Debian:
    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
    sudo apt install libglew-dev

   Fedora:
    sudo yum install sfml
    sudo yum install glew

   MinGW GCC should already be installed on Linux.

 Compiling on Linux is a lot easier and just uses MinGW g++. I've made files for running and compiling in the form shell scripts which you can just run in the terminal or double click.

For Mac

  Prerequisites:
   https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
   https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
   https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-macOS-clang.tar.gz
   brew install glew If you have Brew installed. I don't have MacOS so it might be preinstalled.

 Use clang and Xcode to compile the main file. Again, be sure to link and include SFML Libraries (SFML/Graphics, SFML/System, SFML/Window, SFML/Audio, SFML/Network) for creating the window and GLEW (GL/glew) for OpenGL
